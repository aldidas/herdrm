/// responsible process is MacHerdr — so the `herdr server` we start on demand, and
/// every coding agent it goes on to run, answer their permission dialogs *as
/// MacHerdr*. That is why users see "MacHerdr would like to access data from other
/// apps" while an agent (not MacHerdr) reads a file (issue #87), and why revoking
/// that grant would break the agents rather than MacHerdr.
///
/// Disclaiming responsibility at spawn makes the child its own responsible
/// process, so it — and the tree beneath it — prompts as itself. Every terminal
/// emulator (iTerm2, Ghostty, WezTerm, Terminal.app) makes the same call for the
/// programs it launches, for exactly this reason.
